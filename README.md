# 🚀 Learning Path: Data Engineering + DataOps

Hi, I'm currently learning Data Engineering from scratch through the [IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer) on Coursera.

This repository will contain hands-on projects, notes, and examples as I grow from beginner to confident Data Engineer — with an added focus on **DataOps** practices like automation, CI/CD, and monitoring.
