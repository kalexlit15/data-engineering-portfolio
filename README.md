# Data Engineering Portfolio
# 🛠️ Data Engineering Portfolio

Hi, I'm currently learning Data Engineering from scratch through the [IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-engineer) on Coursera.

This repository will contain hands-on projects and notes as I progress from a beginner to a confident Data Engineer with added focus on **DataOps** practices.
